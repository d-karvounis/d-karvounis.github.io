The larger the marker for an event, the larger is the moment magnitude of the event. Note that only the geochain in 58-32 has been utilized for the location of the events in Stage 1. Consequently, stage 1 should have the least accurate azimuthial estimations out of the three stages and with respect to well 58-32. The horizontal coordinates and especially the Y-coordinate should be affected by this with higher errors than the vertical direction. Also note that a Well-head pressure (WHP) is set to zero (0) for all events during the shut-in and during the back-flow of well 16A-32.
